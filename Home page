  <p><em>WHAT'D THEY THINK?</em></p>
	<p>Survey results</p>
    <center><img src= "./SITtagline.png"></center>
	<br> <br> ShareItTogether's name was created by Jared Maccai. He proposed that the channel be named "ShareItTogether", and all of the members agreed to it. It fit the theme and the type of content that we would be posting. Which is a podcast channel, wherein you SHARE your thoughts and opinions, and the fact that we share these TOGETHER, as a group— ShareItTogether really was the right choice. </p>
	<p><em>TAGLINE</em></p>
	<p>A brand's motto</p>
   <center>><img src="./tagline.png"></center><p> Simply said, "Have a seat, and let's S.I.T", SIT being an abbreviation of ShareItTogether, is a simple invitation to all who would like to partake in our discussion. So, what are you waiting for? A seat has already been reserved for you! </p>
	</p><br>

	<p><em>INTRO VIDEO</em></p>
	<p>A short introduction or trailer of what to expect. Here is a GIF of our intro video and the link to it.
        <center><img src ="./sit_intro_vid.gif"></center>
	<center><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10qyJFwK5_MvuxTFzCfXmwBBhMYbql-s4/view?usp=sharing">ShareItTogether intro video with audio</a></p></center>
	<br> <br> Sofia Bianca was the point person for the creation of the intro video of the channel, the app used to create it, was an app called "Capcut". ShareItTogether's intro video consists of our member's partaking in a discussion, with our logo blocking their face— the reason for that is because we want our audience to be curious of who we are.Our intro video is meant to showcase what the audience should expect from us.
<br><br> Interesting thing to note, this is not our group's original intro. We had to repeat our intro video, because we believe that it lacked an introduction to our content, and plus it had a very noticable watermark at the bottom right.	Take a look at our original intro</p>

  <div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="needofstreaming">
        <h3 class="w3-center">OUR BUMPY, YET FUN JOURNEY ON THE INTERNET</h3>
<p>Now, let's tlk about this intrinsic journey. Youtube is a video sharing, content-uploading website used for all sorts of things. May it be for entertainment purposes,information, or just plain old sharing of experiences, YouTube is a free platform. SIT set its foot on Youtube back in March 20, 2022 and left its mark with a video entitled 
<br>"the world is crumbling, let's talk about it (COVID status, grooming, Ukraine & Russia, BBM or Leni?)". <br> <br>Before it was uploaded, the ShareItTogether team created a storyboard. A storyboard it is like a blue-print for a concept, to better visualize it. Anyway, here's the storyboard.</p> <center?
<br><center><img src="./SIT_STORYBOARD.gif" style="width:80%"> <br><br><img src="./SIT__STOARDYBOARD_ULIT.png" style="width:80%"> </center><br>
  <br>
  <p> After the storyboard, we proceeded to create and record our script. It took the team approximately 8 days to do it, and 2 days worth of editing. Since pasting videos is not really supported here, we will just be showing you the thumbnail. The link to the video is attatched above the thumbnail.</p> 
   <center><p><a href="https://youtu.be/dQyOlkrxd88">The world is crumbling, let's talk about it.</a></p> </center><br><center><img src="./SHARE_IT_TGT.png"  style="width:80%"></center> <br><p> After the video was uploaded, we created and strategized on how we would market our video, and garner attention. We decided to maximize our social media, since people nowadays use it all the time. Memebers would put it in their Facebook timelines, mydays, and would post it on Instagram.

<br> <br> <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BxJIAdH8Mhl5DiUwMbHhwOK6RXOIlssP4VDIB6mXgkY/edit?usp=drivesdk">For more details on our Marketing Plan, you may reffer to this google document</a></p>
<div>
<br><br> <p> In terms of analytics, please reffer to the infographic below:</p><br><img src="./Data_Infographic.png" >
<br><br> <p>It was a rough path, garnering attention, getting out of our comfort zones, and trying to be entertaining, these are all quite difficult to newbies like us. But, with certainty and a lot of time, we will get the hang of it, and maybe we can be able to reach a hundred subscribers! Only time will tell. The SIT Team follows one rule, and that its to speak your thoughts.<br> Happy to say that we have created, yet another video. Here it is:<br><center><img src="./secondvidthumbnail.png" style="width:80%"><br> <a href="https://youtu.be/WjbP-WfG2sY">3-5 years left on earth??!, coachella,+ how's online school going? </a></p></center> <p>and here's the storyboard for it <center><img src="./SIT_SECOND_VID_STORYBOARD.gif"style="width:80%"></center>
 <br><br><h3 class="w3-center">TESTIMONIALS</h3><p>ShareItTogether has been a great way for me,personally, to let out my opinion, and be able to gain confidence in speaking what's on my mind. Editing was a whole lot of fun as well! Hearing my members opinions and thoughts on certain issues makes me intrigued, and I'd love to invite other people on our show!</p><p> In SIT, I was able to speak my mind, and tackle very interesting topics, topics that I thought I wasn't confident enough to talk about infront of an audience.</p><p> Having a podcast was a long-time dream of mine. Podcasts have a special place in my heart, and this quarter fulfilled my dreams. Maybe podcasting is my calling? Jokes aside, ShareItTogether was a fun experience, and something that I enjoyed trying. Looking forward to hearing more opinions on issues today!</p><p>I was able to voice out my opinions, with absolutely no judgement, and though the videos may be lengthy, it is worth it to watch.</p><p> I made my family watch our first upload, and they were already fans. They loved that I spoke confidently, and I was able to look happy and my eyes sparkled when I spoke! Thanks SIT<3 </p><h3 class="w3-center">SUMMARY</h3>
		  <p>SIT was made for a reason. And the reason why it was created is the same reason as to whom it was designed for. For teens, by teens. A symbiotic process of learning and growth. A modern approach to wellbeing, without the need of a paid psychologist. An avenue for self-expression and identity. So, have a seat and let's SIT.</p>
