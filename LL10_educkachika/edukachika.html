<center><img src= "./STUDYTOK_DEMO-copy.png" width="750" height="550"></center>
<p>Based on your audience analysis, choose a streaming category/type that is appropriate to the topic.
 
As per the answers in the survey, JHS students would much prefer a study live stream wherein each member would test out a study habit/ practice popular on TikTok, and using those study methods, each member will study the same topic, and by the end of it, the group will have a quiz regarding the topic studied, in order to see what method is more effective.
 
     We are not, however, closing our doors to other types of streaming content– such as interviews, and just chatting with our audience about  school-related things, etc…

 <p class="w3-center"><em>B. Using The Empathize Stage In The Design Thinking Process<br> </em></p>
 <p>INSTRUCTIONS:<br><br>
 1.) Use the techniques in the Empathize stage of the Design Thinking Process to find a need of viewers in the streaming category that you chose.
<br><br>2.) Maximize the different techniques of the empathize stage.
<br><br>3.) Use the methods of basic research to identify the reason why people of different ages, statuses, beliefs, etc. watch the streams they watch.
<br><br>4.) You can perform research, interview people, and even perform surveys, just make sure that it will not require you to go out of the house.
 
<center><b>SHARING EXPERIENCES  AND OPINIONS</b></center><br>
People, most specifically, Junior High School students watch study sessions, because the thought of someone “studying with you” keeps them company and makes them comfortable. Based on the interviews conducted via gmeet calls with some of the respondents:
<center><img src = "https://group4swebsite444.w3spaces.com/interview.png"width="750" height="550"></center>
<br><p>As per one of the respondents: She chose live study sessions because she would want to see if TikTok study tips were truly effective, and she would want us to serve as testers. She finds watching live study sessions fun because it motivates her to study with the live streamers.
<br><br>In addition, another interviewee had also mentioned that <i>Studystreams bring me comfort—I kinda feel like I'm with friends studying in a cafe. Plus, I really like the fact that your group is gonna be studying differently, and I think it's pretty exciting!</i></p>
<br><br>
<center><b>CHARACTERISITCS OF A GOOD STREAM</b></center><br>
<p>
   <br> <b>To execute a quality </b>-worthy streaming, a creator needs to exhibit a number of attributes. Here are some characteristics:
 
<br><br><b>Presentable streamer</b> - Making a good first impression always starts with appearance! To increase views, it is essential to do this. One gains a lot of self-confidence and speeds up the development of his career by maintaining a respectable physical appearance and using proper etiquette. It's crucial to keep your content open to all audiences since we must also be conscious that the age range of our visitors may vary.
 
<br><br><b>Ability to create good content</b> - People are more inclined to visit your channel if you your contents  with higher skill. People will be interested in seeing more if you pull off an outstanding shot, performance and ability.
 
<br><br><b>Interesting content</b> - Look for opportunities to make jokes or call attention to anything amusing by being creative and proactive in your quest. Many outstanding streamers have become well-known by making people laugh and being amusing.
 
<br><br><b>Accessible stream</b> - Convenience for our viewers is provided via accessibility. Your channel's follower count can grow as a result of greater exposure. Accessibility will make it simpler for users to search and share live content on your channel. They will need to share your content quickly so that their friends can also see it because it necessitates rapid action.
 
<br><br><b>Regular uploads</b> - Consistency is the best strategy for getting viewers to return to your channel, thus it's advised to create a routine for when and how often you'll upload so that people will know when to watch your live streams.
 
<br><br><b>Engaged with viewers/other streamers</b> - Since many viewers prefer a more personal relationship with you than merely watching the streamer, engagement with viewers is crucial. Try to work with other streamers to increase your chances of being noticed or discovered because both of your viewers and theirs may be interested in you.</p>
